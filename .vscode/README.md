# Visual Studio Code Settings, Keybindings and Extensions List

## Settings & Keybindings

See `settings.json` and `keybindings.json`.

These are generally stored in: `/Users/<USER>/Library/ApplicationSupport/Code/User`.

## Extensions

`extensions.txt` contains a list of the extensions I have installed. Run the following command to install them on a different machine (must have VSCode CLI (`code`) installed):

`cat extensions.txt | xargs -L 1 code --install-extension`
